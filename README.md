## SwapPanels

Plugin for [fman.io](https://fman.io) to swap the paths of the right panel to the left panel and vise-versa. It is surprisingly useful command that I use a lot.

Install by uploading "SwapPanels" to your [data directory](https://fman.io/docs/customizing-fman)`/Plugins/Third-party/`.

### Usage

Following my Vim style hotkeys, you can use `<shift>-p` to swap the panels. Or, use `swap panels` from the command prompt.

### Features

 - Sets the current directory for the right panel to the left panel and vise-versa.
